<h1>Long Time No See</h1>
<h3>November 11, 2023</h3>
<p>Last night, I asked my sister what she would do if she ran into a ghost. (We are filipino ex-catholics so we are very superstitious. Most of our relatives say they've seen spirits or <em>aswang</em> and I believe them.) She told me that it's already happened to her, and that the ghost was in my room. This actually made me very jealous because I never noticed anything, and her story lines up with the time my even-more-superstitious aunt and uncle borrowed my room overnight, but couldn't sleep because they "sensed a bad presence".</p>
<p>I asked her if she just happened to see the spirit while walking by, but she admitted that she liked to go in there sometimes and snoop - she was a middle-schooler so I totally get it. She also said she wasn't scared. The room was very cold, and there was a frostbite-ridden lady staring into my lamp, but my sister didn't freak out. She was mostly annoyed at how chilly it was. She stood there for a moment and then left. Then she told our mom, who proceeded to "throw out a bunch of 'suspicious' items in my room" and it went back to normal.</p>
<p>She then told me that she wrote about it for a warm-up in English class, and obviously I wanted to know if she still had that somewhere, but it got thrown away. She said she might have taken a picture of it, but the device she put that on is long gone.</p>
<p>I am now realizing that the title of this entry makes it seem like I saw the ghost again. No, I was just really sad that she wrote down her experience while it was fresh in her mind, but that piece of writing is nowhere to be found. So that's why I've picked up my website's diary. I know I can't trust my memory, and it's better to jot down my experiences as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I'm already seeing the benefits, because creating this entry made me remember the time my other sister said she would be scared to walk by my room. She would all-but sprint past it because it's at the top of the stairs and is literally unavoidable.</p>
