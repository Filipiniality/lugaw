<h1>Site Updates</h1>
<p>Previously, I listed all changes in a matter-of-fact, no commentary summary. I've been introduced to the concept of &quot;working in public&quot;, so now I'll be including notes and whatnot. Hopefully this can be useful to people other than me!</p>

<h2>Lord have mercy I forgor</h2>
<p>UHH hi! It's been two whole years since I've updated this page, despite the fact that my last major update was only a few months ago.</p>
<br>
<p>Realized that I strongly dislike categorizing and making my website granular; I had to read the book "Against the Grain: A Deep History of the Earliest States" for a college class and it peeled my brain open like a can opener. So now I'm just floating through the web, dropping updates as I see fit. I suppose I need to go back to Github, so there's an automatic history log without any extra work on my part.</p>
<br>
<p>Anyway here's a few of the updates that happened in the meantime.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../writings/musings/sanda/">Little blog post where I gush over the Sanda anime PV and show off the panels I'm excited to see.</a></li>
  <li><a href="../writings/umineko/ep1/">Umineko liveblog.</a> Currently only has ep1 and ep2. Yeah uhh, remember how I said I was going to pace myself and not move on to other episodes until I posted my liveblog? I went guns blazing into ep4 hot on the tails of ep3, and I think the correct course of action would have been to take a break, because tl;dr the combined heaviness of ep3+4 triggered me and I ended up needing to take a break from Umineko.</li>

  <li><a href="../deltarune-containment/">Deltarune sketch dump</a></li>

<h2>July 2023</h2>
<p>After fiddling with <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a> and <a href="https://deadlogs.shroom.ink/">DeadLogs</a>, I've decided to manually code my blog pages. I highly recommend both, but personally I couldn't find a way to make them feel right for me! As I explored other services, I also came across <a href="https://speakthesky.com/code/zonelots">Zonel<strong>o</strong>ts</a>.</p>
<h2>June 2023</h2>
<p>I'm having a lot of fun making Honeycomb stamps and uploading them to my <a href="../silly-stuff/">graphics collection</a>. I realized that with a 1x1 transparent PNG, you can make the stamps form different shapes! The one on my page looks like a heart because of that.</p>
<h2>May 2023</h2>
<p>I figured out how to put everything on github! <a href="https://github.com/Filipiniality/lugaw">You can look at the source code over here</a>. On top of the standard deploy-to-neocities action, I used <a href="https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-dependency-tree">11ty-dependency-tree</a>. Also, <a href="https://github.com/M1ssM0ss/deploy-to-neocities-template">here's the step-by-step process</a>, if you were as lost as me.</p>
<h2>April 2023</h2>
<p>I'm trying to make my website more accessible, starting with the images. I had to go through all my pages, anyway, because I switched to Eleventy. So, I took the time to add alt text to <em>most</em> pictures, but I've certainly missed some.</p>
<br>
<p>To lessen eyestrain (becuase let's be honest, I have a big problem with gifs) I've started implementing <a href="https://github.com/ctrl-freaks/freezeframe.js/tree/master/packages/freezeframe">Freezeframe.js</a>, with some adjustments.</p>
<pre><code>$(function() {
const e = new Freezeframe({
        trigger: 'click', /* disables animated on hover. */
        responsive: false, /* preserves image resolution */
        });
    $(&quot;#play-gif&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function(){e.start()});
    $(&quot;#stop-gif&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function(){e.stop()});
    });
</code></pre>
<p>Above constructor modified from <a href="https://bechnokid.neocities.org/resources/tut_freezeframe">Bechnokid</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>By default, Freezeframe allows you to hover over GIFs to play them. I disabled it as a personal preference - to me, the split-second of animation when your mouse passes over an image is jarring.</p>
<br>
<p>Another quirk of Freezeframe is that the images will auto-scale to fit their container. Setting <strong>responsive</strong> to <strong>false</strong> gets rid of that.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, I noticed that Freezeframe inherently adds <strong>vertical-align: top</strong> as inline CSS to each image. I'm getting around this by setting it to <strong>initial</strong>.</p>
