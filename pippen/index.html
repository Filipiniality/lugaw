            <li>He's a 13-year old Maltese.</li>
            <li>Weighs only 4 pounds, but can be up to 5 if his hair grows long enough.</li>
            <li>One time he got attacked by a neighborly dog, but he made a full recovery, and the neighbors paid for his surgery, so we're all good.</li>
            <li>Has two lumps of fat on his tummy because of said surgery. They're squishy!</li>
            <li>UPDATE: Previously, I wrote that he has 8 teeth. However, he is now toothless and much happier as a result. We have to chop up his food really fine, and I think he likes the extra attention. It makes him feel aristocratic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>An assortment of nicknames my family has given him, in roughly chronological order are: Dogis, Big Boba Eyes, Mr. Pips, Pipis, Crystal Chuu Chuu, Chubby Lovely, Crumb Crumb, Chubbathy Bubbathy.</p>
