<h1>Ort</h1>
<p>I call it &quot;ort&quot; because it is a portmanteau of &quot;old&quot; and &quot;art&quot;. It's stuff from 2020 and before, which isn't too long ago, but I haven't drawn anything since then. So these'll be different than something I draw today! Also some comments on the drawings, because why not.</p>
<h4>Multimedia Stuffs</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>(2019) I was really proud of those sunflowers, so I reused them on this website. I &quot;rendered&quot; them in Cosmic Blobs while I had Spider-Verse playing in the background. It played twice before I finished the flowers. The pixel-y stuff was made in DotPict on my phone. I drew Miles with a marker brush irl and colored it in CSP.</p>

<img src="DoppyHotline.png" alt="Multimedia drawing of Doppio from JJBA">
<blockquote>
<p>(2019) Second foray into Cosmic Blobs. The phone is based on the cover of Jack Stauber's Baby Hotline. The background is a cardboard box that my sibling had been cutting up for their own art project. I made it all glitchy using <a href="https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort">this Processing script</a>. This is technically also a collab with my dear friend Alice, because she redlined Doppio for me. <a href="https://sta.sh/215r9maqbh2c">Look at how skinny and inaccurate he was before the redlines!</a></p>

<h4>No backgrounds here, but I'm still proud of them</h4>
<img src="Okina.png" alt="A sketch, bust-up drawing, and full-body drawing of Okina Matara from Touhou">
<blockquote>
<p>(2020) I have lost the brush settings for this since then :( It was a very unruly brush but the thick gooeyness was kinda fun, if bad for drawing anything but moeblob characters.</p>

<img src="Nessa.png" alt="Gym Leader Nessa. Kneeling while playing with her hair in one hand and holding a PokeBall in the other.">
<blockquote>
<p>(2020) I wanted to draw all the SwSh gym leaders but I gave up.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>(2019 I think) My friend Alice's OC, <a href="https://toyhou.se/188579.anathema-human-">Anathema</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2018) From late 2017 to 2019 I was extremely invested in Doki Doki Literature Club. I bought the Switch ver. but I haven't actually played it yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(2017 I think) Redraw of a Steven Universe screenshot. After all this time I still have Complicated Feelings.</p>

<h4>Comms I did that I'm still proud of</h4>
